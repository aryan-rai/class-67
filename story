Once upon a time in a forest there lived a monkey, who resided on a berry tree.
Which was on the banks of the river. In the same river there lived 
a crocodile and his wife. 
One day the crocodilecame to the banks of the river and rested under the tree.
The kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits. The crocodile came 
back the next day for more fruits as he loved them.
As days passed by the monkey and the crocodile became good friends.
